Recently I've found myself provisioning new rails apps on an almost daily basis to either test an idea out or build a quick proof of concept. This Rails Application Template provisions an app with the basics and even deploys to Heroku.

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```
rails new app-name --database=postgresql -m ./rails-app-templates/rails-app-template.rb

```

Requirements
------------

You'll need a basic Rails development enviroment setup.
