Recently I've found myself provisioning new rails apps on an almost daily basis to either test an idea out or build a quick proof of concept. This Rails Application Template provisions an app with the basics (Bootstrap, HAML, etc.) and deploys your shiney new project to Heroku.

Install
-------

Clone then run:

```
rails new app-name --database=postgresql -m ./rails-app-templates/rails-app-template.rb

```

Requirements
------------

1. You'll need a basic Rails development enviroment setup.
2. Assumes you have a Heroku account (and the CLI tools installed).

To Do
------------

1. Add (conditionaly) Devise and a base user model.
2. Refactor to be installed from URL (so cloning isn't needed).
3. What else goes into almost every Rails app you build?

Contributing
------------

Feel free to contribute and submit a pull request or log something in issues.
